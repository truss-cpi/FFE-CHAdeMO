Code and info for after-market CHAdeMO modifications to the Ford Focus Electric

The data provided has not been vetted or officially validated in any way. It is provided with no warranty and is used entirely at your own risk. 

High Voltage DC can easily maim or kill and should only be worked on by appropriately trained professionals.

You assume all responsibility if you damage anything or hurt/kill anyone using this code or information - and you agree that the creator of this repository will not be held liable in any way.

Remember: Not only will this kill you, it will hurt the whole time you're dying.

UPDATE:
After having boards made with the original design I've discovered omissions and errors. Additionally, specific characteristics of the original hardware were incorrectly cataloged, leading to a final circuit design that did not match the original working configuration.

I've re-worked the circuit to address all these issues and, once verified, the new schematic and board will be posted.
