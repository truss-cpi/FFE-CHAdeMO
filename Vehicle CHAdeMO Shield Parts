The overall function of the original CH4D3M0 hardware has been laid out on on a double-sided Arduino Shield form factor.

All components except the chips (one CANBus transceiver and two optoisloator packages) are through-hole form factor to:
  Provide flexibility in the routing of traces
  Eliminate the need for embedded vias
  Allow for the greatest degree of hand assembly
 
 Integrated screw terminals allow this shield to be directly connected to the comm wires of the CHAdeMO inlet and the control wires of the DC contactors.
 
 This would allow for the board to be mounted at the inlet and only the HV and control wires would need to extend to the contactors and TCM.
