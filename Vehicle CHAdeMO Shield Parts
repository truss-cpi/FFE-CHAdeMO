The overall function of the original CH4D3M0 hardware has been laid out on on a double-sided Arduino Shield form factor.

All components except the chips (one CANBus transceiver and two optoisloator packages) are through-hole form factor to:
  Provide flexibility in the routing of traces
  Eliminate the need for embedded vias
  Allow for the greatest degree of hand assembly
 
 Integrated screw terminals allow this shield to be directly connected to the comm wires of the CHAdeMO inlet and the control wires of the DC contactors.
 
 This would allow for the board to be mounted at the inlet and only the HV and control wires would need to extend to the contactors and TCM.

Parts list so far is:

Shield I/O connectors
1	1x10	Stacked Header or pin header
5	1x8 	Stacked Header or pin header
2	2x9 	Stacked Header or pin header
1	2x3 	Stacked Header or pin socket (SPI passthrough)

Debug pin header access/passthrough
1	1x4 	Stacked Header or header socket

1	1x4 	Pin Header, External Isolated 5V Supply, Optional OR
1	Power Supply	JCM1512S05, optional, https://octopart.com/search?q=JCM1512S05&currency=USD&specs=0
An external 5V power supply can be connected to the 4-pin area centered under the normal supply footprint.
It MUST be a sufficiently isolated supply (1500V+) or CHAdeMO chargers will fail their impedance check.

1	1x3 	Pin Header + jumper, Selectable Relay Isolation, Optional - put the 5V relays on the isolated 5V power or the host power. Can be hard soldered if selection isn't desired
